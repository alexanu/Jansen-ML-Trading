### Chapter 11: Gradient Boosting Machines

This [chapter](11_gradient_boosting_machines) explores boosting, an alternative tree-based ensemble algorithm that often produces better results. The key difference is that boosting modifies the data that is used to train each tree based on the cumulative errors made by the model before adding the new tree. In contrast to random forests, which train many trees independently from each other using different versions of the training set, boosting proceeds sequentially using reweighted versions of the data. State-of-the-art boosting implementations also adopt the randomization strategies of random forests. 

More specifically, in this chapter we will cover the following topics:

### Chapter 12: Unsupervised Learning

Dimensionality reduction and clustering are the main tasks for unsupervised learning: 
- Dimensionality reduction transforms the existing features into a new, smaller set while minimizing the loss of information. A broad range of algorithms exists that differ by how they measure the loss of information, whether they apply linear or non-linear transformations or the constraints they impose on the new feature set. 
- Clustering algorithms identify and group similar observations or features instead of identifying new features. Algorithms differ in how they define the similarity of observations and their assumptions about the resulting groups.

More specifically, this [chapter](12_unsupervised_learning) covers:
- how principal and independent component analysis perform linear dimensionality reduction
- how to apply PCA to identify risk factors and eigen portfolios from asset returns 
- how to use non-linear manifold learning to summarize high-dimensional data for effective visualization
- how to use T-SNE and UMAP to explore high-dimensional alternative image data

Unsupervised learning to model latent topics and extract hidden themes from documents. They speed up the review of documents, help identify and cluster similar documents, and can be annotated as a basis for predictive modeling.

### Chapter 17:	Convolutional Neural Networks

CNNs are named after the linear algebra operation called convolution that replaces the general matrix multiplication typical of feed-forward networks. CNNs are designed to learn hierarchical feature representations from grid-like data. One of their shortcomings is that they do not learn spatial relationships, i.e., the relative positions of these features. 

[Convolutional Neural Networks](17_convolutional_neural_nets/17_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.pdf)

More specifically, this [chapter](17_convolutional_neural_nets) covers

### Chapter 18:	Recurrent Neural Networks

Each output is a function of both previous output and new data. Prominent architectures include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) that aim to overcome the challenge of vanishing gradients associated with learning long-range dependencies, where errors need to be propagated over many connections. 

RNNs have been successfully applied to various tasks that require mapping one or more input sequences to one or more output sequences and are particularly well suited to natural language. RNN can also be applied to univariate and multivariate time series to predict market or fundamental data. This chapter covers how RNN can model alternative text data using the word embeddings that we covered in [Chapter 15](15_word_embeddings) to classify the sentiment expressed in documents. 

[Recurrent Neural Networks](18_recurrent_neural_nets/18_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.pdf)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a computational approach to goal-directed learning performed by an agent that interacts with a typically stochastic environment which the agent has incomplete information about. 

This [chapter](20_reinforcement_learning) shows how to formulate an RL problem and how to apply various solution methods. It covers model-based and model-free methods, introduces the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment, and combines deep learning with RL to train an agent that navigates a complex environment.
